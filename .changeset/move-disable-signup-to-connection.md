Move `disable_sign_ups` from the client to the connection. The flag now lives on `connection.options.disable_signup` (already present in the schema, now wired into the signup path), and the client-level `disable_sign_ups` column / field has been removed.

**Why:** the client flag gated every connection through a single switch, which forced federated and HRD-routed logins through the same block as password signup — there was no way to allow new users in via an enterprise OIDC connection while still gating database signups. The new shape lets each connection decide independently. `hide_sign_up_disabled_error` stays on the client because it is a UX (enumeration-safety) decision, not a signup-gating one.

**Where it's enforced:**

- `preUserSignupHook` resolves the connection passed to it (by name, falling back to strategy) and checks `options.disable_signup` — this is the authoritative check, and runs for all signup methods including federated/HRD callback.
- The identifier / login / passwordless screens read `disable_signup` off the `Username-Password-Authentication` connection only, since those screens decide whether to show the "Sign up" link before the user has chosen an IdP.

**Migration / breaking change:** the kysely and drizzle migrations backfill `options.disable_signup = true` onto every connection whose id appears in the `connections` array of a client with `disable_sign_ups = true`, then drop the client column. If multiple clients share a connection and only one had signups disabled, the connection now blocks signup for all of them — this is the natural consequence of moving from client-scope to connection-scope. Customers relying on the previous "this app doesn't onboard but other apps do" semantics for a shared connection should express that with a pre-user-registration action instead.
