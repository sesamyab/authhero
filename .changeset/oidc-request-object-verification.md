Verify signed Request Objects at `/authorize` (RFC 9101 / OIDC Core §6.1) and add support for `request_uri` (§6.2). Previously the `request=` JWT was decoded without checking its signature — any caller could forge claims and have them merged into the authorization request. That hole is now closed.

Behaviour changes:

- `request=` JWTs are signature-verified against the client's keys. `alg=none` (unsigned request objects) is rejected. HS256/HS384/HS512 verify against `client_secret`; RS*/ES* verify against the client's `registration_metadata.jwks` (inline) or `client_metadata.jwks_uri` (fetched). The verifier also enforces `iss == client_id` (when present), `aud` matching the OP issuer, and `exp`/`nbf` with 30s leeway.
- `request_uri` is now accepted. The URL is fetched with an SSRF guard (https-only by default, blocks `localhost` and private/loopback/link-local IPv4 + IPv6 ranges, 5s timeout, 64 KiB body cap) and the JWT body runs through the same verifier.
- Sending both `request` and `request_uri` is rejected with HTTP 400 per the spec.
- Discovery now advertises `request_uri_parameter_supported: true` and adds `request_object_signing_alg_values_supported: ["RS256","RS384","RS512","ES256","ES384","ES512","HS256","HS384","HS512"]`.

For tests/local development, set `ALLOW_PRIVATE_OUTBOUND_FETCH: true` on the env binding to relax the SSRF guard (allows `http://`, `localhost`, and private IPs).
