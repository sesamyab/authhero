OIDC connections can now choose how client credentials are sent to the upstream token endpoint via `options.token_endpoint_auth_method` (`client_secret_basic` — default — or `client_secret_post`). This fixes providers like JumpCloud that reject HTTP Basic auth at the token endpoint with `invalid_client`. The setting is editable in the react-admin connection form on the OIDC strategy.

Under the hood the OIDC strategy uses `ExtendedOAuth2Client`, a small subclass of arctic's `OAuth2Client` (`strategies/internal-oauth2.ts`) that overrides `validateAuthorizationCode` for the `client_secret_post` path. Arctic's PKCE/URL/auth-URL logic and `OAuth2Tokens` shape are reused unchanged. Other strategies (Apple, Facebook, GitHub, Google, Microsoft, Vipps, generic OAuth2) still use arctic directly — they will be migrated in a follow-up PR.
