Add Auth0-style refresh-token rotation and at-rest hashing.

- New wire format `rt_<lookup>.<secret>`. The `lookup` slice is indexed in `refresh_tokens.token_lookup`; only the SHA-256 of the secret is persisted in `token_hash`. Internal ULID `id` stays as the primary key.
- New per-client config in `Client.refresh_token`: `rotation_type: "rotating" | "non-rotating"` (default `non-rotating`) and `leeway` seconds (default 30). Set `rotation_type: "rotating"` to opt a client into rotation.
- Each rotation issues a fresh child sharing `family_id` with the parent. Re-presenting a rotated parent within `leeway` mints a sibling (concurrent-call tolerance); outside `leeway` it triggers reuse detection and revokes the entire family via the new `revokeFamily` adapter method.
- Admin `DELETE /api/v2/refresh_tokens/:id` now also revokes the rest of the family.
- Backwards compatible: legacy id-only refresh tokens keep working until `2026-06-05`. After that date a follow-up PR removes the legacy fallback.
